Problem Statement

Foodbox is a restaurant chain that delivers food items of different cuisines at affordable prices. It was established in 2014 in Bengaluru, India. It had been serving fine all these years, however, the business analysts noticed a decline in sales since 2016. They found out that the online ordering of food items with companies, such as Swiggy and Foodpanda were gaining more profit by eliminating middlemen from the equation. As a result, the team decided to hire a Full Stack developer to develop an online food delivery web application with a rich and user-friendly interface.
You are hired as the Full Stack Java developer and are asked to develop the web application. The management team has provided you with the requirements and their business model so that you can easily arrange different components of the application.

    Features of the application:
    Registration
    Login
    Payment gateway
    Searching
    Filtering
    Sorting
    Dynamic data
    Responsive and compatible with different devices
    
    Admin Portal:
    The admin portal deals with all the backend data generation and product information. The admin user should be able to:

    Add or remove different cuisines to or from the application to build a rich product line
    Edit food item details like name, price, cuisine, description, and offers to keep it aligned to the current prices
    Enable or disable the food items

    User Portal:
    It deals with the user activities. The end-user should be able to:

    Sign-in to the application to maintain a record of activities
    Search for food items based on the search keyword
    Apply filters and sort results based on different cuisines to get the best deals
    Add all the selected food items to a cart and customize the purchase at the end
